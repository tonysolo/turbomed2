# Turbomed
Turbomed is a solo medical practice and therapist practice management application written using Borland C++ Builder.
It has been stable for many years (since 1986). 
It uses a simple data structure, storing data as a single CSV text file containing all the data for the practice. 
Turbomed handles all the features needed for solo practices including billing, printing, EDI, as well as spreadsheet compatable 
clinical statistics and practice management reports.
